<h1>Sports Management Software</h1>

<h3>Le Wagon Bootcamp final project</h3>

This project was done in a two-week sprint for the final demo day of the Bootcamp at Le Wagon Portugal. 

Professional sports clubs (for example soccer, basketball and futsal), still use many apps to organize and store all the information about their athletes and staff (training routines, injury reports, nutrition reports, meetings and training schedules). 

With this project, we tried to fill that gap in the organizational world of sports clubs by creating an app that allows staff and athletes to centralise all communication and all team-related information in just one place.

Because this is meant to be an organizational software involving every member of a sports club, we had some issues narrowing it down to a simple app that was doable within two weeks. To resolve this issue, we had to concentrate on just one user experience and, in this case, we used the experience of a Logistics Manager for a soccer club.

As we added a chat to the app, we had some trouble with the users, as we weren't able to create new users. We had to change the structure of the database so it was possible to add new users to the same team. 

I'm still working on this project and I'm looking forward to adding new features to it.
